## Scenario 6: Persistent Halitosis (Bad Breath)

### Roleplayer Card No. 6

```
ROLEPLAYER CARD NO. 6
SETTING: Local Dental Clinic
PATIENT: You are 35 years old and have been experiencing persistent bad breath for the past three months. You have had an examination.
TASK:
• When asked, say you've had bad breath for about three months now. It's really embarrassing at work and affecting your confidence. You haven't had this problem before. You've tried mouthwash and breath mints, but nothing seems to help.
• When asked, say you brush your teeth once a day, usually in the morning. You don't floss because you find it difficult and you've never really got into the habit. You use mouthwash every day. You haven't been to a dentist in about five years. When asked, say you haven't noticed any bleeding when you brush, but sometimes your gums feel a bit tender. You don't have any pain or loose teeth.
• Ask if this is something serious or if it's just bad breath that everyone gets sometimes.
• When asked, say you really hope this can be fixed quickly; you have an important presentation at work next month and you're quite anxious about being close to people.
• Say you understand now that this will take time and proper oral hygiene; you're willing to start flossing daily and come back for regular appointments.

TASK:
• When asked, say your daughter was playing on the climbing frame at school when she fell and hit her mouth. One of her top front teeth came completely out. The school called you straight away. You brought the tooth with you in a container with some milk. There was quite a bit of bleeding at first, but it's stopped now. When asked, say her mouth is swollen and she's quite upset and in pain. You gave her some paracetamol about 30 minutes ago. She didn't lose consciousness; it was just her mouth that got hurt.

• When asked, say you understand about the antibiotics and soft diet. You're just worried about how long it will take to heal and whether there might be any problems.
• When asked, say you're not sure about the tooth being replanted. You're worried it might fall out again or get infected. You wonder if it might be better to wait and get a false tooth later when she's older.
