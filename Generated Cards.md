### Roleplayer Card No. 6

ROLEPLAYER CARD NO. 6
SETTING: Local Dental Clinic
PATIENT: You are 35 years old and have been experiencing persistent bad breath for the past three months. You have had an examination.
TASK:
• When asked, say you've had bad breath for about three months now. It's really embarrassing at work and affecting your confidence. You haven't had this problem before. You've tried mouthwash and breath mints, but nothing seems to help.
• When asked, say you brush your teeth once a day, usually in the morning. You don't floss because you find it difficult and you've never really got into the habit. You use mouthwash every day. You haven't been to a dentist in about five years. When asked, say you haven't noticed any bleeding when you brush, but sometimes your gums feel a bit tender. You don't have any pain or loose teeth.
• Ask if this is something serious or if it's just bad breath that everyone gets sometimes.
• When asked, say you really hope this can be fixed quickly; you have an important presentation at work next month and you're quite anxious about being close to people.
• Say you understand now that this will take time and proper oral hygiene; you're willing to start flossing daily and come back for regular appointments.
